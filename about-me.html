        I studied computer science @ uchicago and graduated in june 2023. later that month,
        I rode a spaceship and landed in the film universe. currently, I work at a lighting & grip

                My journey into CS:
                <br>
                <br>
                In high school, I was enamored with the idea of being a surgeon. When college application
                season rolled around, I made a decision to apply to as many combined BS/MD programs as I could.
                By the time everything was said and done, only one program - FAU's Med Direct Program - had accepted me.
                I was estactic and promptly committed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Little did I know that I would soon regret this decision. It's hard to say what changed in between high school 
                and my first year at college, but all I knew was that I lost that passion for medicine that I once had.
                Around the time when I was processing this realization, COVID hit the United States and I was sent home for the remainder
                of my freshman year.
                <br>
                <br>
                I had a lot to think about a lot of things during this period of remote schooling. Away from campus, 
                I was able to seriously entertain ideas of walking away from the BS/MD program and leaving everything behind - 
                ideas that were once just distant fantasies. One day, it hit me that I loved living in these alternate realities and 
                dreaded going back to what was my real life at the time.
                <br>
                <br>
                Long story short, this period of reflection became the start of my journey to leave the BS/MD program and transfer out of FAU. 
                Now, I'm in my last year at UChicago, doubling in computer science and math with broad 
                interests in theoretical CS and a passion for game development. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If you've read this far, thanks so much! I'm really happy
                my story got the chance to reach you.
