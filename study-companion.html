                        <h3>Light sensor mode</h3>
                        Objective: Shine red LED, sound buzzer, and display a reminder on the OLED display once the darkness in room reaches a certain level. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I wired the light dependent resistor (LDR) to an analog input pin of the ATSAMD21G18 microcontroller,
                        a red LED to a digital output pin, and a buzzer to a digital output pin.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Logic in code: If the value coming in from the input pin connected to the LDR is less than or equal to a certain value, 
                        I write a HIGH value to the digital pin connected to the red LED and also to the digital pin connected
                        to the buzzer. Finally, I change the text of the OLED display to "turn on the light!".

                        This part was really simple! 
                        <br> 
                        <br> 
                        Logic in code: Once the button is pressed to change to this mode, I erase the existing text 
                        on the OLED display and replace it with "PRODUCTIVITY MODE" followed by an encouraging message.

                        <h3>Mode button (allow change from Light Sensor Mode to Productivity Mode and vice versa)</h3>
                        I wired the mode button to a digital input pin of the microcontroller and then enabled the internal pull-up in the code. 
                        <br> 
                        <br> 
                        Logic in code: I keep a counter of how many times the button has been pressed by tracking the number of times
                        input value changes from HIGH -> LOW and LOW -> HIGH and dividing by two (the division by two is because every time the button
                        is pressed, there is a change from HIGH -> LOW and another one from LOW -> HIGH). Then, I mod the value 
                        stored by the counter by two to tell me which mode should be displayed on the OLED display.

                        <h3>Fixes</h3>
                        There were so many fixes I had to do! Ironically though, the open heart surgeries I had to do on my board 
                        turned out to be my favorite part of the project.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To start, I made the rookie mistake of accidentally making two variable names for the 3.3V power source in the KiCad schematic: "+3V3" and "+3.3V",
                        the latter of which was not connected to any power source. 
                        Lucky for me, though -- I had a test pad that was connected to "+3.3V", so I just connected it to the 
                        "+3V3" pad of the buzzer using an external wire.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Another mistake I made was connecting the mode button completely incorrectly in the KiCad schematic.
                        From the datasheet, it's clear that when the button is pressed, pins 1, 3, and 4 short. However, I wired up
                        pins 1 and 2 in the schematic (facepalm), and also neglected to add a pull-down nor pull-up resistor. I didn't 
                        realize these mistakes until I had already soldered on the button, so here's what I did instead: I got as much solder as I 
                        could off of pin 2 (which was connected to +3V3), pried the leg up, then connected pin 4 (previously floating) to the GND pin on the 
                        Q1 NPN transistor using an external wire. Finally, I enabled the internal pull-up resistor in the Arduino code. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The third mistake I made was accidentally burning off the traces for the SCL and SDA lines of the OLED display. It was a simple fix, though -- 
                        all I had to do was connect the SCL and SDA pins to the SCL and SDA pads of the two resistors connected in those same tracks using two 
                        external wires.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        The final fix I did was to remove the D4 diode, which was recommended in the datasheet of the buzzer to be placed in parallel with it. 
                        When I had the diode in, the buzzer would make a quiet clicking sound instead of buzzing, and after debugging for a bit, 
                        my TA and I concluded that it had to be the diode causing problems. We desoldered it, and the buzzer started working! Strange.
