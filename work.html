                    I designed and soldered this printed circuit board (PCB) using a few key components, including a ATSAMD21G18 mirocontroller, 
                    a light dependent resistor (LDR), and a mode button. The board is powered with 3.3V - 5V via USB-C.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    There are two modes (for now!) that the PCB can toggle between: light sensor mode and productivity mode. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The light sensor mode reminds you to get up and turn on the light when the brightness in the room decreases to a certain level.
                    A buzzer sounds to alert you, a red LED lights up, and the OLED displays a message to let you know.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The productivity mode is really just a "positive affirmations" mode in disguise, teehee. Though I haven't yet, I plan to 
                    populate the screen with encouraging text that scrolls across the screen, motivating me to keep going as I study!

                    During the remote internship, I worked with one other student to adapt the museum's card game into a simple, educational browser game.
                    The game concept is built around the art museum environment and takes inspiration from the tower defense 
                    subgenre: players are tasked with using artifacts as defender units to protect their base against enemies. 
                    Enemies are typical things which would damage pieces in an art museum, such
                    as mold and camera flashes ("light monsters"). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I learned a lot in the process of building this game alongside my teammate. From searching up how to open the 
                    developer console in Chrome, to making pixel art, to figuring out how to "make the mold walk on level 1", I 
                    discovered a love for game-making and its unqiue place right at the crossroads between creative and technical processes.

                    When I was younger, my dad would play a board game with me. The rules were simple: (1) Pieces can only move
                    in the column they are originally in; (2) Pieces cannot hop over each other nor be stacked on top of each other; (3) On both players'
                    first move, they cannot cross the "river", which runs horizontally across the center of the board; (4) A player loses when they have 
                    no more valid moves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After numerous games which all ended in defeat, my dad told me that there was a deterministic way to win the game. He challenged me to figure 
                    out the trick; unfortunately, I never did, and he eventually told me. I decided to program this game with those secrets in mind, allowing
                    the computer to get into winning positions when it sees the opportunity to do so. Of course, to make it fair for the human player,
                    the computer will sometimes make a move at complete random without regard to how disadvantageous its position would become. Thus, it's possible to 
                    win against it, as long as you are careful with your moves.
